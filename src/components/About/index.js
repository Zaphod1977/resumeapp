        My name is Bobby Bridges. I am a 47 year old father, business owner, and now full stack developer.
        I have been in the tech world since I was a kid taking audio gear apart to figure out how it
        worked and how to make it do different things I wanted to make it do. That engenuity brought me
        to the audio/video and automation world back in July of 2000. From there I have rose to be one
        of the leading integrators in my region and also one of the most respected. But.....I've always
        wanted to learn how to write code and to discover the underpinnings of the computing world I so
        richly appreciate. So here I am...47, coding daily & working towards proficiency. The next
        chapter will be to discover the new opportunities my newly earned skills will present me.
